The idea of this program is to combine the two different json files that we have into one json file that contains all of the information needed

Course.java:
	-This file is the Class File for a Course 
	-It contains the information that is needed from the course and that is found in the genEdcourse Json file

JsonReadIn.java:
	-This file is what actuall combines the two files together
	Steps in the code:
1.Creates a ArrayList that picks up all of the information-> This is called courselist in the code
2.reads in all of the General Education Electives
3.read in all of the courses and compares them to see if they are in the arraylist already, if they are not then they are added to the Arraylist
4. In order to print out the Json properly, you convert each item into json and add a comma to the end
5.it prints out the entire string of all of the json, which can be copied from the  output and have to remove the last comma
6.in order to have it work properly you need to add the proper header so that the array will be read properly from the javascript on the website :) 

JsonCourseInfoConverger Folder:
	-this is the file system that contains all of the files if you were to use netbeans
	-put the json files that you want to insert going through the path: src>main>resourses
	-make sure to change the name of the filenames before you run the program
